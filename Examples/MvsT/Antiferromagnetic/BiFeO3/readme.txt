This directory shows how to set up an antiferromagnetic system
that is not cubic. In this case we have a poor man's BiFeO3 with
the primitive unit cell. It is a "poor mans'" BiFeO3 as we only
treat the Fe and we treat the Fe-Fe interaction as a direct
exchange. Furthermore, we only assume that the exchange is nearest
neighbour.
