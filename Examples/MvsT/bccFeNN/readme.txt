To calculate M(T) the simulation flags for MvT should be set. The essential
ones are the starting, ending and change in temperatures. The only files
needed are:
-config file
-unit cell file
-exchange file

The damping in the unit cell file should be set to 1.0 (critical damping) so
that the magnetisation relaxes to it's equilibrium quickly.
